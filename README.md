### TODO

- Add checkboxes next to the feeds discovered so people can choose to subscribe to those feeds or not by just checking a box. Last step is generating the OPML

### Future

- Follow all rel="me" links and try to find feeds there too
- Sites like about.me don't include those links in some cases; special case them?
